## ðŸ“– Description

I am creating a portfolio using React to showcase the projects I have developed so far. This involves creating the initial scaffolding for my first portfolio site and updating or creating other materials that illustrate my skills to potential employers. By using React technology, I aim to create a professional and modern portfolio that sets me apart from other developers. I am confident that my portfolio will highlight my experience, expertise, and creativity, and leave a lasting impression on anyone who views it.
